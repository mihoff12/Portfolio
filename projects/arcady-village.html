                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>Arcady Village is a cozy singleplayer game that combines two distinct gameplay loops. The player takes on the role of an arcade hall owner in a small-town setting.</p>
                
                <h3>Gameplay Loops</h3>
                <div class="mechanics-grid">
                    <div class="mechanic-card">
                        <h4>Daily Exploration</h4>
                        <p>During the day, the player explores the town, interacts with NPCs, and participates in various activities.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mechanic-card">
                        <h4>Arcade Hall Management</h4>
                        <p>In the evenings, the gameplay transforms into a management scenario, in which the player must run their arcade hall.</p>

                <h3>My Role & Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>As part of a two-person development team, I've contributed to virtually all aspects of the game development process:</p>
                <ul class="role-responsibilities">
                    <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Developed multiple arcade games, implemented the main gameplay loop, created the relationship system between the player and NPCs, programmed individual NPC characteristics, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Created environmental elements including buildings, trees, and decorative objects</li>
                    <li><strong>2D Art:</strong> Designed pixel art and vector graphics primarily for the arcade games</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>This project began during my Master's studies in collaboration with a fellow student. We started with an initial concept, refined it through detailed planning, and then moved into active development. The project has been an excellent opportunity to apply academic knowledge to a complex, practical game development challenge.</p>

                <h3>Arcade Games</h3>
                <p>A core aspect of the game is the ability to populate the arcade hall with a variety of arcade machines. Numerous small arcade games in 2D or 3D have been developed and implemented within the game.</p>
