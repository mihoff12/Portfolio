                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>Arcady Village is an innovative life and economic simulation that combines two distinct gameplay loops. The player takes on the role of an arcade hall owner in a small-town setting.</p>

                        <h4>Daily Exploration</h4>
                        <p>During the day, the player explores the town, interacts with NPCs, and participates in various activities. Each day offers new opportunities for exploration and interaction.</p>

                        <h4>Arcade Hall Management</h4>
                        <p>In the evenings, the gameplay transforms into a management scenario, in which the player must run their arcade hall.</p>

                <h3>My Role & Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>As part of a two-person development team, I've contributed to virtually all aspects of the game development process:</p>
                <ul class="role-responsibilities">
                    <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Developed multiple arcade games, implemented the main gameplay loop, created the relationship system between the player and NPCs, and programmed individual NPC characteristics</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Created environmental elements including buildings, trees, and decorative objects</li>
                    <li><strong>2D Art:</strong> Designed pixel art and vector graphics primarily for the arcade games</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Effects:</strong> Implemented and modified shaders, set up post-processing effects, and created particle effects in Unity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>This project began during my Master's studies in collaboration with a fellow student. We started with an initial concept, refined it through detailed planning, and then moved into active development. The project has been an excellent opportunity to apply academic knowledge to a complex, practical game development challenge.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                <p>The most significant learning from this project has been properly estimating scope. Developing a game that contains multiple smaller games within it proved to be a substantially larger undertaking than initially anticipated. This experience has greatly improved my project planning and time estimation skills.</p>

                <h3>Arcade Games</h3>
                <p>A core aspect of the game is the ability to populate the arcade hall with a variety of arcade machines. Numerous small arcade games in 2D or 3D have been developed and implemented within the game.</p>
