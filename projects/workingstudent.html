                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>As a working student in the Research Team at Siemens, I was involved in evaluating and developing innovative technologies. The focus was on exploring new techniques and assessing their potential application in larger projects.</p>
                
                <h3>Primary Projects</h3>
                <div class="mechanics-grid">
                    <div class="mechanic-card">
                        <h4>Digital Twin Development</h4>
                        <p>Development of a virtual representation of a factory floor based on 3D scans of real machines. The virtual environment was optimized for both desktop and VR applications.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mechanic-card">
                        <h4>WebXR & Distributed Rendering</h4>
                        <p>Porting the Digital Twin project to web platforms to improve accessibility. Research into advanced rendering techniques such as WebGPU and distributed rendering to optimize complex 3D scenes.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Responsibilities & Activities</h3>
                <ul class="role-responsibilities">
                    <li><strong>3D Scan Optimization:</strong> Reduction of object complexity for efficient performance in Unity</li>
                    <li><strong>Scene Creation:</strong> Development of materials, lighting settings, and interactive information panels</li>
                    <li><strong>Animation:</strong> Implementation of realistic robotic arm animations using Inverse Kinematics for precise 1:1 simulation</li>
                    <li><strong>WebXR Development:</strong> Porting 3D environments to web platforms with a focus on optimization</li>
                    <li><strong>Distributed Rendering Research:</strong> Evaluation of various techniques such as object-based, viewport-based, and tile-based rendering</li>
                    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Simulation of distributed rendering concepts using Docker containers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Digital Twin Project</h3>
                <p>The Digital Twin project focused on the virtual replication of a factory floor with its machines and robots. The particular challenge was to optimize complex 3D scans for Unity while maintaining visual quality.</p>
                
                <div class="technical-highlight">
                    <h4>Technical Focus: Inverse Kinematics</h4>
                    <p>A special emphasis was placed on developing an efficient animation system for complex robotic arms. By utilizing Inverse Kinematics, I implemented a system that only requires the position data of the end effector to simulate realistic movements of the entire robotic arm. This significantly reduced the amount of data needed and enabled precise 1:1 simulation of the real equipment.</p>

                <h3>Distributed Rendering</h3>
                <div class="technical-highlight">
                        <h4>Object-based Rendering</h4>
                        <p>Distribution of rendering load by dividing different 3D objects across multiple devices. Each device renders a portion of the scene, and the results are combined.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="technical-highlight">
                        <h4>Viewport Rendering</h4>
                        <p>Division of the screen view into multiple areas rendered by different devices. The partial views are then composited into a complete image.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="technical-highlight">
                        <h4>Tile-based Rendering</h4>
                        <p>Subdivision of the screen into smaller tiles that can be dynamically distributed across various rendering nodes. This enables flexible load balancing based on the complexity of each tile.</p>
                    </div>
                <p>For simulating these rendering approaches without physical device networks, I employed Docker containers. These functioned as virtual rendering nodes and allowed for the validation of concepts in a controlled environment.</p>
